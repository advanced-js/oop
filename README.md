# Object Oriented Programming exercise

## V1

Make a base `SuperHero` class. Give it some properties, and actions (methods) that change those properties.

1. Write a test for what it should do in [tests.js](js/tests.js).
1. Open [index.html](index.html) to run the tests.
1. Define the class in [super_hero.js](js/super_hero.js), and make the tests pass.
1. Repeat from step 1.

## V2

Make at least one of the methods interact with another `SuperHero`, such as `attack()` or `giveMotivationalSpeech()`.

## V3

Make 2+ `SuperHero` subclasses that have two or special properties and actions, with tests covering all of the functionality.
